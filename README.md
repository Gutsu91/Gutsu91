Web aside, I love to listen to music, to play game (boardgames or videogames) and look at beautiful pictures / movies. 

## What I did
I've studied PR but never actually worked in the field. I did SEO for a major belgian E-commerce company and CRM in an industry that... Well, quite needs CRM. I always loved the technical bits I could have during my (professional) life, and this is the reason I decided to (try to) became a Front-end developper.
