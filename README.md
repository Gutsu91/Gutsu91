# Hello, Readme

## Who am I (beside what's stated in my bio)
I'm 30-ish (I know exactly how much, I swear, but I don't want to update this section each and every year). I live in Belgium and I can speak French (mother-tongue), English, and Non-sense (second mother-tongue). Web-aside, I love to listen to music, to play game (boardgames or videogames) and look at beautiful pictures / movies. 

## What I did
I've studied PR but never actually worked in the field. I did Technical SEO and Analytics for a major Belgian E-commerce company and also CRM in an industry that... Well, quite needs CRM. I always loved the technical bits I could have during my (professional) life, and this is the reason I decided to became a Front-end developer.
